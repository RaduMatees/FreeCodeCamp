            <h3>Here's a time line of Patterson's life:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1922</span> - Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, U.S.</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>xxxx</span> - Graduated from Grinnell College with a degree in chemistry</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>xxxx</span> - There, he met his future wife, Lorna (Laurie) McCleary</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>xxxx</span> - Both were then sent to work on the Manhattan Project, first at the University of Chicago and then at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where he encountered mass spectrometry</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>xxxx</span> - After WW2, Patterson studies for his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under Harrison Brown</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1948</span> - Patterson teams up with George Tilton to do geological aging on zircons</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1952</span> - After a postdoctoral year at Chicago, Patterson moved with Brown to the Division of Geology at  California Institute of Technology as founding members of its geochemistry program</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1952</span> - Brown was able to commission a new mass spectrometer in Pasadena, California at Caltech</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1953</span> - Brown brought Patterson along with him to Caltech, where Patterson was able to build his own lab from scratch, creating one of the first "clean rooms" ever, in order to prevent lead contamination of his data. Brown's spectometer was of great help</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1956</span> - With the new data, he published “Age of Meteorites and the Earth”, the first paper containing the true age of the solar system’s accretion</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>xxxx</span> - Patterson returned to his initial experiment which in which is data was skewed with to much lead.</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1964, '65</span> - He determined, through ice-core samples from Greenland and Antarctica that atmospheric lead levels had begun to increase steadily and dangerously soon after tetraethyl lead began to see widespread use in fuel</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1965</span> - Patterson publishes <i>Contaminated and Natural Lead Environments of Man</i>, trying to draw public attention to the problem of increased lead levels in the environment</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1971</span> - Patterson was excluded from a National Research Council (NRC) panel on atmospheric lead contamination, even though he was then the foremost expert on the subject.</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1975</span> - The United States mandated the use of unleaded gasoline to protect catalytic converters in all new cars starting with the 1975 model year</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1986</span> - Patterson's efforts accelerated the phaseout of lead from all standard, consumer, automotive gasoline in the United States by 1986. Lead levels within the blood of Americans are reported to have dropped by up to 80% by the late 1990s</li>
              <li><span class='bolded'>1995</span> - Patterson died in his home in Sea Ranch, California, at the age of 73 on December 5, 1995</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>"True scientific discovery renders the brain incapable at such moments of shouting vigorously to the world “Look at what I’ve done! Now I will reap the benefits of recognition and wealth.” Instead such discovery instinctively forces the brain to thunder “We did it” in a voice no one else can hear, within its sacred, but lonely, chapel of scientific thought."</h4>
