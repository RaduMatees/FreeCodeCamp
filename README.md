**FreeCodeCamp** is an open source community dedicated helping you learning to code.
More than 200.000 people visit https://www.freecodecamp.org each month to work
through their free open source web development curriculum.

They have certifications that you can obtain by completing their courseworks,
such as Front End Evelopment, Data Visualization, Back End Development, and
Full Stack Development. The courseworks are structured lessons, algorithms and
projects, which are harder as you go.

This repository contains my work from the Front End Development coursework, and
it's structured into two parts, the algorithms challenges and the projects.
The skills which I have learned and exercised are **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**,
**jQuery** and **Bootstrap**. To earn the certification, I built **10 front end projects**
and implemented many **JavaScript algorithms**.
