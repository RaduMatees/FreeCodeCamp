This are my solutions to **FreeCodeCamp's** algorithms challenges, challenges
of which difficulty ranges from beginner to advanced. Working on them helped me
develop an analythical thinking, introduced me to programming concepts like
functional programming, and I have brushed up my problem solving skills.
Also, I have gained experience working with things like strings, Regex, numerical
problems, arrays and nested collections of arrays, objects and nested objects, etc.
